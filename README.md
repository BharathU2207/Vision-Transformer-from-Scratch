A simple implementation of the ViT-base architecture proposed in the paper - [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale]([url](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929).
The model was created from scratch and trained on a sample dataset consisting of images from three classes - Pizza, Sushi and Steak.
